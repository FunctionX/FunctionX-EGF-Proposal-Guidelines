* This is the deployed UI design for FinTax. The platform’s comprehensive functionality spans various essential services, including seamless data import from both exchanges and blockchain networks. Users can easily select specific tax events, facilitating the automatic generation of detailed tax filing forms to streamline the compliance process. Additionally, FinTax provides a comprehensive dashboard that offers an overview of all transaction and account information, allowing users to monitor their crypto assets in real-time. This user-friendly interface is designed to enhance transparency and simplify the complex tasks of financial management and tax reporting.

* In addition, we plan to expand this functionality by incorporating AI-driven conversational interactions that will guide users through the entire tax filing process. This enhancement aims to provide a seamless, interactive experience, making it easier for users to navigate complex tax requirements with step-by-step assistance.

* Technology stack

  Our entire stack of components is built under the permissive MIT open-source license, ensuring flexibility and transparency in our development process. This includes a range of robust technologies such as **MyBatis-Flex** for database interaction, **JDK 21** for a modern Java runtime, **Spring Boot V3.2.X+** for rapid and efficient application development, and **Lombok** for code simplification.

### **Ecosystem Fit/Impact**

#### **Details:**

* Where and how does your project fit into the ecosystem?
FinTax achieves seamless integration with Pundi AIFX, allowing users to efficiently access on-chain data and streamline their financial and tax reporting needs. As the first dedicated tax and financial management tool within the Function X ecosystem, FinTax leverages internal resources and technology to enhance the tax filing experience for users. Additionally, we plan to develop a semantic analysis-based intelligent Q&A model, utilizing the ecosystem’s AI capabilities, which is scheduled for launch in Q1 2025 to further simplify the tax reporting process for users.

* What problem are you solving?
FinTax addresses the challenges faced by individual users in managing multiple accounts, complex crypto assets, and varying tax filing requirements across jurisdictions. Our platform simplifies this complexity through automated data integration and intelligent analysis, allowing users to efficiently complete their tax reporting process.

* Who is your target audience (parachain/dapp/wallet/UI developers, designers, your own user base, some dapp's userbase, yourself)?
The primary target audience for FinTax includes all Function X ecosystem users, as tax compliance is a fundamental requirement for nearly all users. Moreover, by offering an easy and convenient tax filing experience, FinTax aims to attract users beyond the existing ecosystem, potentially expanding the Function X user base.

* Who will benefit, and how: what tools or opportunities will people have that they didn't have before? What will be possible that wasn't possible before? Do you have anything tangible to give back to the community like airdrops?
Function X ecosystem users will benefit directly from FinTax, as it enables the generation of financial reports and tax documents from on-chain data, simplifying tax processes, improving efficiency, and reducing manual errors. Additionally, FinTax contributes back to the ecosystem through the TaxDAO community, offering high-quality tax and financial data.

* What need(s) does your project meet?
FinTax addresses the growing need for streamlined tax reporting. By providing an efficient and convenient solution, FinTax empowers users to manage complex multi-account, multi-asset tax compliance requirements effectively.

* Are there any other projects similar to yours in other EVM/Cosmos ecosystem?
Within the Function X ecosystem, FinTax is the only tax and financial management tool available. While other ecosystems may offer similar services, they lack a semantic analysis-based intelligent Q&A feature, as well as the same level of integration and expertise that FinTax brings to Function X.


### **Development status**

We have completed foundational work on FinTax’s core functionalities for personal tax reporting, covering jurisdictions such as the U.S., Canada, Japan, South Korea, Australia, New Zealand, Hong Kong, and Singapore. Additionally, we are preparing to initiate R&D on an AI-driven semantic analysis and Q&A model in Q1 2025 to further enhance the user experience.

#### Details:

* We have an expert organization dedicated to researching and analyzing Web3 financial and tax knowledge. This team frequently updates its findings, insights, and publications to ensure the most relevant and timely content is available to the community. Our commitment to advancing the understanding of crypto-related financial and tax regulations is demonstrated through continuous research and articles published on our content platform. You can find our comprehensive resources at https://www.thetaxdao.com/.
* We use PingCode for task management, which is a platform similar to Jira, designed to help teams collaborate effectively and manage complex projects. Currently, we are adopting a centralized development approach, and therefore, we do not provide public access to our development boards or task management system. However, we can share periodic exports of our work plans and milestones to keep stakeholders informed. At this time, we do not open GitHub issues for external participation. This approach allows us to maintain focus and streamline our development process while still offering transparency through planned updates as needed.
* Previous interface iterations, such as mock-ups and wireframes
* What are the most significant obstacles facing your project or your team right now?
Our primary challenge at the moment is the shortage of development engineers, which limits our capacity to fully implement and integrate with the Function X ecosystem as quickly as desired. This has created a need for additional budget to support development resources for ecosystem integration and deployment.
* What are some of your most pressing needs?
To achieve effective integration and promote FinTax within the Function X ecosystem, we are seeking:
1. Budget for Developer Resources: This would enable us to expand our team, accelerate development, and ensure a smooth integration and deployment with the Function X ecosystem.
2. Ecosystem Marketing Support: We also aim to publish content within the ecosystem to build awareness and promote FinTax to a broader audience, ultimately contributing to user engagement and adoption within the Function X community.
